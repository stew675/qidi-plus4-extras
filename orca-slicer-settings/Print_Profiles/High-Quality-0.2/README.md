# 0.2mm Layer Height High Quality Profile

## Recommendation for high quality wall surfaces

**It is STRONGLY recommend** to set the minimum layer time to no less than 10s in the filament settings (See box highlighted in Yellow in the image below)

Also ensure that the `Slow printing down for better layer cooling` and `Don't slow down outer walls` boxes are checkmarked as active (See below image)

Doing this will ensure there is sufficient time for the filament to bond properly to the preceding layer, as well as solidify sufficiently before the next layer is added.

For smaller models this will also ensure a more even layer time, which will minimise visible ridging on the walls around transitions from solid to sparse infill areas.

## Importing Settings

While the Tab Settings from the below sections demonstrate the changes made in image form, the profile can be imported into OrcaSlicer directly.

First download the [profile JSON file](https://github.com/stew675/qidi-plus4-extras/blob/main/orca-slicer-settings/Print_Profiles/High-Quality-0.2/0.20mm%20-%20High%20Quality%20-%20QDN040.json)

Then do: `File -> Import -> Inport Configs...` and then choose the JSON file you just downloaded.  That should import the full profile in one step.
